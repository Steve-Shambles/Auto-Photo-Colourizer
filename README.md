Important Note: The 122MB file "colorization_release_v2.caffemodel" is too big to upload here, but you can download it from here:

https://code.naturkundemuseum.berlin/mediaspherefornature/colorize_iiif/blob/master/experimental/model/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel

I have checked it downloads okay and it's very fast. Add this file to the aPC main dir with the other APC files.
