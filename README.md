Important Note: The 122MB file "colorization_release_v2.caffemodel" is too big to upload here, but you can download it from here:

https://code.naturkundemuseum.berlin/mediaspherefornature/colorize_iiif/blob/master/experimental/model/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel

I have checked it downloads okay and it's very fast. Add this file to the APC main dir with the other APC files.

I started this project back in 2021, I have revived it and made a few tweaks but hoping to make more improvements over time.

I spent a lot of time learning how to make this icon menu, was very proud I got it right at the time ;-)
